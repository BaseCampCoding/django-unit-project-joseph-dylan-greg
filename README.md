- Users can review definition flash cards
- Users can view tutorial videos on programming languages
- Users can take quizzes to test their knowledge on content
- Users can view their progress on the quizzes on how many were correct or incorrect

## To do:
- Add more complicated content questions and definitions
- Make the definition flash card system random and work with javascript to make it update in real time

## Project Status
The projects current status is a prototype and all of the features work 100%, but some of the features are currently not updated how we want them from the To do: list above.



## Inspiration
Our cards clone was based off of our coding instructors website he made for new students to learn Python also known as "Cards". Dylan, Greg, and myself were thinking of
something to do for our 4th Unit Project and we ended up narrowing it down to a clone web page of our Instructors website. Obviously we did not have the complete knowledge of
making it 100% the same with added features so we did the next best thing and made features that we could handle as a prototype of sorts to help future students learn how to code.
