## General Info
This project was made to be a prototype learning resource page to help students knowledge of coding languages using flashcards, videos, and questions.



## Technologies Used
- Visual Studio Code



## Launch



## Features
- Users can login/logout/signup
- Users can change their password
- Users can make daily reflections and weekly/unit summaries
- Users can review their most recent reflection/summary
- Users can review definition flash cards
- Users can view tutorial videos on programming languages
- Users can take quizzes to test their knowledge on content
- Users can view their progress on the quizzes on how many were correct or incorrect
- Users can view a resource page with links to free resources



## To do:
- Add more complicated content questions and definitions
- Make the definition flash card system random and work with javascript to make it update in real time
- Possibly add more styling to the web page
- Make it so the user can review all reflections/summaries



## Project Status
The projects current status is a prototype and all of the features work 100%, but some of the features are currently not updated how we want them from the To do: list above.



## Inspiration
Our cards clone was based off of our coding instructors website he made for new students to learn Python also known as "Cards". Dylan, Greg, and myself were thinking of
something to do for our 4th Unit Project and we ended up narrowing it down to a clone web page of our Instructors website. Obviously we did not have the complete knowledge of
making it 100% the same with added features so we did the next best thing and made features that we could handle as a prototype of sorts to help future students learn how to code.
