## Description and Motivation
Dylan, Greg, and myself want to create a clone of Nate's website for future students of Base Camp. The website would include multiple choice, true/false, definitions,
videos, and other features recommended by the current students at base camp. The videos and definitions would mainly be for people to memorize the information they are learning.
While the questions would help test that information from each student using the website. Our Motivation for the project is to create a dumbed down version of our coding
instructor Nate Clark for a possible alternative to his pre-existing cards.nateclark.io.

## Prior Art
Our website that we are trying to build is based off of our coding instructor's website cards.nateclark.io which hopefully will be used to help future student's of Base Camp.

## Core User Workflows
The core user workflows that our project should have include a user being able to login/logout of the website, select a questionaire type of their choice to learn information
about the current coding language they are learning, and selecting definitions or videos to help strengthen their knowledge. Other features will be added in the future
after we receive feedback from the current students on what to add.

## Week 1 Tuesday-Friday Daily Goals
#### Tuesday: Have base template for website operational. 
Dylan will work on question models and user model, Joseph will work on templates, and Greg will start working on questions and content.

#### Wednesday: A user can login/logout, change their password, navbar with links to everything (no content/questions yet), to greet the user on the navbar, and add definition/html for video section. As a bonus make sure the models/views are configured to host the content.
Greg will work on the models/views, Joseph will work on the definitions, and Dylan will work on the html section for videos.

#### Thursday: Start implementing the questions/definitions/videos and make reflections work on the page. 
Greg will implement the questions, Joseph will implement definitions, and Dylan will implement videos. If 
one or more of our group finishes our implementation of the content we will help our peer finish their implementations or will start working on the reflections page.

#### Friday: By the end of Friday users can navigate through the site, watch videos, look at definitions, answer questions, login/logout. 
For anything that is not finished or broken should be fixed by either myself, Greg, or Dylan by the end of Friday.

## Week 2 Monday-Thursday Daily Goals
#### Monday: CSS/Bootstrap styling on the website and more content added to the website. 
Dylan and Joseph will work on styling with CSS/Bootstrap and Joseph will also work
on adding some more definitions if necessary. Greg for now will continue making enough questions and if he makes enough plans will change for him to help with styling.

#### Tuesday: Complete unfinished styling in the morning, the streak feature for questions, and configuring the admin site. 
Joseph will complete any unfinished styling on the
website, Dylan will work on a possible question streak feature for questions or an alternative feature to add for questions, and Greg will work on configuring the admin site.

#### Wednesday: Start bug testing on website/unfinished features. 
Dylan, Greg, and myself will either work on unfinished features or features that have bugs.

#### Thursday: Finish bug testing and complete deployment. 
Dylan, Greg, and myself will either work completing bug testing or deployment.

#### Friday: Finish README.md and plans for presentation.
